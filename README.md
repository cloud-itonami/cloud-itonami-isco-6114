# cloud-itonami-isco-6114

Open Occupation Blueprint for **ISCO-08 6114**: Mixed Crop Growers.

This repository designs a forkable OSS business for an independent smallholder mixed-crop grower: a field robot performs sowing, weeding and harvest-support work across diverse crop plots under a governor-gated actor, so the grower keeps their own operating records instead of renting a closed farm-management SaaS.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a field robot performs sowing, weeding and targeted harvest support across mixed crop plots under an actor that proposes
actions and an independent **Mixed Crop Governor** that gates them. The governor never
dispatches hardware itself; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as
operating near buyers/visitors on-site, or applying treatments near water sources) require human sign-off.

A live sample of the operator console (robotics safety console, shared template) is rendered in [docs/samples/operator-console.html](docs/samples/operator-console.html) — pure-data HTML output of `kotoba.robotics.ui`.

## Core Contract

```text
planting plan + crop mix + market order
        |
        v
Crop Advisor -> Mixed Crop Governor -> tend/harvest, or human sign-off
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + operating records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, suppress
an operating record, or disclose sensitive data without governor approval and
audit evidence.

:intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                           +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)

```

- `src/mixed_crop/store.cljk` — `Store` protocol +
  `MemStore`: registered crop plots, committed records, an
  append-only audit ledger.
- `src/mixed_crop/advisor.cljk` — `Advisor` protocol;
  `mock-advisor` (deterministic, default) proposes a tend or harvest
  operation from a request; `llm-advisor` wraps a
  `langchain.model/ChatModel` — either way the advisor only ever
  produces a `:propose`-effect proposal, never a committed record, and
  LLM parse failures always yield `confidence 0.0` (forces escalation,
  never fabricated confidence).
- `src/mixed_crop/governor.cljk` —
  `MixedCropGovernor/check`: a pure function, wired as its own
  `:govern` node. Hard invariants (unregistered plot, a proposal
  whose `:effect` isn't `:propose`) always route to `:hold`. Escalation
  invariants (`:operate-near-buyers-visitors`,
  `:treatment-application-near-water`, or low advisor confidence)
  always route to `:request-approval` — an `interrupt-before` node
  that the graph checkpoints and only resumes on explicit human
  approval (`actor/approve!`), matching the README's robotics-premise
  statement that operating near buyers/visitors on-site, or applying
  treatments near water sources, always require human sign-off.
- `src/mixed_crop/actor.cljk` — `build-graph`, `run-request!`,
  `approve!`: the `langgraph.graph/state-graph` wiring itself.
